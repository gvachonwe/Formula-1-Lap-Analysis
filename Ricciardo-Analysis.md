# Performance Analysis: Daniel Ricciardo 


## Background

Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo is one of the most beloved figures in Formula 1. He first joined the grid in 2012, where he partnered the french driver Jean-Eric Vergne at Scuderia Toro Rosso. After two promising seasons with their junior team, Red Bull promoted Ricciardo to drive alongside 4-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel in 2014. That year, he scored three wins and finished ahead of his more-experienced teammate in the World Drivers' Championship (WDC). He performed well alongside Daniil Kvyat (2015-2016) and youngster Max Verstappen (2016-2018), scoring four more wins for the Red Bull team.

Following his unexpected move to Renault in 2019, Ricciardo struggled to extract good results from an unreliable car. He finished the season in a disappointing 9th place in the WDC, having suffered many retirements and a disqualification in Japan. 2020 proved the be an excellent improvement for the driver, with two podiums and an 11-race point-scoring streak. He ended the season with more than double the points he had scored the previous year and claimed 5th in the WDC.

Ricciardo made another unexpected career move when he left Renault for McLaren in 2021. He was brought into the iconic British team to partner their promising young driver Lando Norris. However, the Australian significantly underperformed compared to his teammate. He made only 14 Q3 appearances to Norris' 21 and finished 45 points behind in the WDC. Ricciardo's win in Monza suggested that he had returned to his previous form, although his disappointing results continued into 2022. During the 2022 summer break, McLaren announced that the team and Ricciardo would be parting ways at the end of the 2022 season. It remains unknown if Daniel Ricciardo will compete in the 2023 season.


## Introduction

Daniel Ricciardo's sudden decline in performance has been a contentious topic within the Formula 1 community. Many have stated that McLaren's tricky car is to blame for his inconsistency or that he has lost the natural ability he possessed in his early career. In conducting this analysis, I am interested in understanding the reason's behind Ricciardo's poor run of form at McLaren. I will be presenting graphs created using the Python packages FastF1 and Matplotlib. I will base my conclusions on Ricciardo's performances at the Circuit de Monaco.
